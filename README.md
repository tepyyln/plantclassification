**PlantClassification
Overview**
PlantClassification is a desktop application developed as part of the RTC project by students. It implements a Neural Network (NN) for plant species classification. The backend is built using Rust for high performance and safety, while the frontend is developed with Qt to provide a cross-platform, user-friendly interface.

**Features**
Plant Species Classification: Utilizes a Neural Network model to classify plant species based on input data.
Cross-Platform Desktop App: Built with Qt to ensure compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Efficient Backend: Leverages Rust's performance and memory safety for robust backend processing.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive GUI for easy interaction with the classification system.

**Tech Stack**
Backend: Rust
Frontend: Qt (C++ with Qt bindings for Rust)
Neural Network: Custom NN implementation (or specify library if used, e.g., tch-rs for PyTorch bindings in Rust)
Build Tools: Cargo (Rust package manager), Qt Creator

**Getting Started**
_**Prerequisites**_
Rust: Install Rust via rustup.
Qt: Install Qt 5 or 6 (recommended) from the Qt website or via package manager.
CMake: Required for building Qt-based projects.
Cargo: Included with Rust installation.
_**Installation**_
Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/username/PlantClassification.git
cd PlantClassification

Install dependencies:
Ensure Qt and Rust are installed.
Run cargo build to fetch Rust dependencies.
Build the project:cargo build --release
Run the application:cargo run --release

**Usage**
Launch the application.
Input plant data (e.g., images or feature vectors) via the Qt-based GUI.
The Neural Network processes the input and outputs the predicted plant species.
View detailed classification results in the interface.

**Common Errors and Solutions**
**Error 1:** Qt not found or Could not find Qt5Core
Description: This error occurs when the Rust build system cannot locate the Qt installation, often due to missing environment variables or incorrect Qt paths.
Solution:
Ensure Qt is installed correctly and added to your system PATH.
Set the QT_DIR environment variable to point to your Qt installation directory. For example:export QT_DIR=/path/to/Qt/6.5.0

Verify CMake can find Qt by running:cmake --find-package -DNAME=Qt5 -DCOMPILER=clang

If using rust-qt-binding-generator, ensure the qmake path is correctly specified in your build configuration.

**Error 2:** Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64 or Linker errors
Description: Linker errors often arise due to mismatched Rust and Qt versions or incorrect library linking.
Solution:
Ensure the Rust toolchain is up-to-date:rustup update

Verify that the Qt version used matches the bindings in your Cargo.toml. For example, use qt5 bindings for Qt 5.x.
Clean and rebuild the project:cargo clean
cargo build --release

If the issue persists, check for architecture mismatches (e.g., building for x86_64 on an ARM system). Specify the target explicitly:cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

**Error 3**: Cargo build fails with tch-rs or other NN library errors
Description: Errors related to tch-rs (if used for the Neural Network) often stem from missing dependencies like libtorch or incorrect configurations.
Solution:

Install libtorch as per the tch-rs documentation:wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cpu/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.0.0%2Bcpu.zip
unzip libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.0.0+cpu.zip
export LIBTORCH=/path/to/libtorch

Ensure the LIBTORCH environment variable is set before building:export LIBTORCH=/path/to/libtorch
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBTORCH/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
If using GPU support, ensure CUDA is installed and compatible with libtorch.

**Error 4:** GUI does not render properly or Qt runtime errors
Description: The Qt frontend may fail to render or crash due to missing Qt runtime libraries or incorrect widget configurations.
Solution:
Ensure Qt runtime libraries are available in your system PATH or bundled with the application.
For Linux, install necessary Qt dependencies:sudo apt-get install libqt5widgets5 libqt5gui5
Verify that the Qt version used in development matches the runtime version.
Check the Qt widget code for errors (e.g., incorrect signal-slot connections). Debug using Qt Creatorâ€™s debugger.
